            <p>This view evaluates individual Stanley customer support agents based on the outcomes they deliver across Process Adherence, Issue Resolution, and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT).</p>
            <p>Instead of static QA scores, agent performance is understood through outcome patterns that explain why customers have different experiences with similar Stanley product issues.</p>
            <p>Over the past week, agents demonstrated strong overall process adherence, consistently following recommended troubleshooting steps for common issues like lid leaks and handle stability. However, outcomes varied based on how agents adapted these processes.</p>
            <p>Agents who combined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) adherence with proactive resolution actions (e.g., offering timely replacements or clearly explaining next steps) achieved higher resolution rates and stronger customer satisfaction. In contrast, calls involving repeat or wear-related Stanley product issues showed lower resolution effectiveness when agents relied solely on procedural troubleshooting without escalation.</p>
            <p>Customer satisfaction was highest when agents clearly set expectations, confirmed resolution, and demonstrated ownership, even if immediate resolution wasn't possible. These patterns indicate clear opportunities for targeted coaching and SOP refinement to improve consistency across the team.</p>
